# Space-and-Engineering-Academy-Senior-Project
To graduate as a student of the Space and Engineering Academy, each senior is required to form a team and complete a long-term senior project. The project benefits a community organization and must demonstrate planning, engineering, and teamwork skills.

In other words, the project must be built by hand by the team of seniors, and it must be the best representation of every skill you've obtained in the Academy over your four years of high school.

My team's project was a Harry Potter-themed bookcase that specifically held each of the seven books in the series, complete with an animatronic sorting hat that reacted when books were interacted with, and a mechanical door that opened to reveal the books with the wave of an Infrared Wand, meant to simulate the scene in Harry Potter where Hagrid taps the brick wall with his magical umbrella to reveal Diagon Alley.

The bookcase was delivered to our city's public library to enhance the sense of immersion of the Harry Potter World for children in hopes of enticing them to read the series. My team spent a total of 400+ hours on the project, including my personal share of about 250 hours.

This was by far the hardest project I have ever worked on with my team. We encountered countless problems on the way, in regards to mechanics, structure, and electronics. However, this was also the best learning experience I could've asked for, and it taught me a lot of lessons that I will definitely keep for the future.
